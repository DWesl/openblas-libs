Legal notice

Objconv is an open source program published under the conditions of the GNU General
Public License, as defined in www.gnu.org/licenses/. The program is provided without any
warranty or support.
It may in some cases be illegal to modify, convert or disassemble copyright protected
software files without permission from the copyright owner. It is an open question whether it
is legal to modify or convert a copyright protected function library and use it for other
purposes than presupposed in the license conditions. It is recommended to ask the vendor
for permission before developing and publishing any software that is built with the use of a
converted copyright protected function library.
Copyright law does not generally permit disassembly of copyright protected software for the
purpose of circumventing a copy protection mechanism, for using part of the code in other
contexts, or for extracting the algorithms behind the code.
European, Australian and US copyright law does, however, under certain conditions permit
reverse engineering of copyright protected software when the purpose is to extract the
information necessary for establishing interoperability with other software, and only to the
extent necessary for this purpose. However, I am not a legal expert. The user should seek
legal advise before deciding whether it is legal to use objconv on copyrighted software for a
specific purpose.
